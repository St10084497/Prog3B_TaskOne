## Game Overview
The Dewey Decimal Game is a Windows application developed using Visual Studio 2019. It consists of three main pages: Splash, Main Navigation, and Replacing Books. In this README, we will focus on the Replacing Books page and provide information about its functionality and usage.

The Replacing Books page of the Dewey Decimal Game offers the following features:

- **Generating Dewey Decimal Numbers**: You can generate a set of Dewey Decimal numbers combined with random letters by clicking the "Generate" button. These numbers are displayed in the first ListView.

- **Sorting Challenge**: The objective of the game is to sort the generated Dewey Decimal numbers and letters in ascending order in the second ListView. You can move items between the two ListViews by selecting an item and clicking either the "Move to ListView 2" or "Move to ListView 1" button.

- **Checking Order**: You can check if the items in the second ListView are sorted in ascending order by clicking the "Check Order" button.

- **Timer**: The game features a timer that starts when you click the "Generate" button. The elapsed time is displayed, and it stops when you complete the game.
